# Content Locks

A WordPress plugin which allows specified users to prevent certain pages, posts, attachments or custom post types from being edited or deleted.

Originally created as a way to give us a user interface to prevent the deletion of reusable blocks on client sites.

## Installation

Install via Composer (`composer require deliciousmedia/content-locks`), or just clone/copy the files to your plugins folder.

## Todo

- Add indicator to show status in post list.
- Improve documentation (usage section).
- Consider improved UI for attachments (adding has to be done via 'edit more details' link; removal link only shows on list view).
- More granular permissions, per user rather than role.
- UI to configure which post types are supported.
- WP CLI command to add/remove locks.
- Locks for taxonomy terms (via termmeta).
- Option to remove all locks/data upon uninstall.
- Add ability to lock items via bulk actions.
